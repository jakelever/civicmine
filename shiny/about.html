<h3>About</h3>

<p>
	This resource is built as an aid to curation of the <a href="http://civicdb.org">CIViC database</a> based at the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu">McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University</a> in St Louis. All data in this resource has been automatically extracted using text mining tools
</p>

<p>
	We use a supervised learning approach where a set of experts have annotated a large set of sentences to be used as examples for a machine learning system. This machine learning system is <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/kindred">Kindred</a>, a Python package for relation extraction. It is the successor to our <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/VERSE">VERSE system</a> that won part of the <a href="http://2016.bionlp-st.org">BioNLP'16 Shared Task</a> for relation extraction. This machine learning system is then applied to all abstracts in PubMed and all full text papers in the Pubmed Central Open Access subset.
